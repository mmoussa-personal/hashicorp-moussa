# Understand Git commands

Use Git commands to synchronize content between your local branch and a remote repository.

- `git fetch`
- `git pull`
- `git merge`
- `git push`

## About git fetch

Use the `git fetch` command to add content from a remote repository to your local working branch. Use this command if you want to see the commits that are on the remote branch before you commit them to your local branch. The command doesn't commit content to your local branch. 

To merge content to your local branch, use `git pull` followed by `git merge`.
